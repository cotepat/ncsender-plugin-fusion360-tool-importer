# Logo Placeholder

This plugin needs a logo.png file (256x256 px recommended).

The logo should represent:
- Fusion 360 branding/colors (orange/blue)
- Tool library import concept
- ncSender integration

Until a logo is created, the plugin will use ncSender's default plugin icon.

To add a logo:
1. Create a 256x256 PNG file
2. Name it `logo.png`
3. Place it in this directory (replace this placeholder file)
4. Update the release notes
